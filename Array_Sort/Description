***************************** Types of techniques to sort arrays *************************

1. SELECTION Sort: Find the minimum element in unsorted array and swap it with element at the beginning.
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
           
2. BUBBLE Sort: Repeatedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.           
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
 For n element array, we need to do n-1 iterations before we get our sorted array.
 For ith iteration, we go upto n-ith element
 
3. INSERTION Sort: Insert an element from unsorted array to the correct position in its sorted array.
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
            
4. MERGE Sort: It is a type of divide and conquer algorithm in which we recursively call merge sort function tp divide our array to the simplest form possible then 
               keep sorting and merging the elements simultaneously. 
            Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
            Space Complexity:
