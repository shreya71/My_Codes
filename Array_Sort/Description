***************************** Types of techniques to sort arrays *************************

1. SELECTION Sort: Find the minimum element in unsorted array and swap it with element at the beginning.
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
           
2. BUBBLE Sort: Repeatedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.           
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
 For n element array, we need to do n-1 iterations before we get our sorted array.
 For ith iteration, we go upto n-ith element
 
3. INSERTION Sort: Insert an element from unsorted array to the correct position in its sorted array.
            Time Complexity: O(n^2)
            Space Complexity: O(1)
