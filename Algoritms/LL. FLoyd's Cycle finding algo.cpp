/*******************************************************************************************
Basically we have two pointers in this algo, one fast and other slow.
The time when faster moves by 2 nodes slower moves 1 node. So till the 2nd pointer reaches NULL or the last node of the LL
(depending on even and odd nodes present respectively) the first pointer reaches the midlle elements as per the conditions. 

1. Used to find middle elment
2. or used in cyclic LL
3. etc etc
